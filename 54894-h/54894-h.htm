<p class='c007'><i>Fanny</i>—A kind salutation to my noble
friend.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Bennett</i>—Where’s Wyckoff?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Fanny</i>—I don’t know.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Bennett</i>—Will he return soon?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Fanny</i>—I guess not.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Bennett</i>—Then come and sit in my lap.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Fanny</i>—I will. (She bounds to Bennett’s
knees.)</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Bennett</i>—Now kiss me.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Fanny</i>—There! (Smack! smack! smack!
and the last on his lips.)</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Bennett</i>—O! how sweet!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Fanny</i> (archly)—You don’t say!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Bennett</i>—Yes, I do.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Fanny</i>—And so do I.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Bennett</i>—Then give me another cluster of
kisses.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Fanny</i>—I’ll give you a dozen or a hundred, if
you will only <em>puff</em> me well, and fill the theatre
every night.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Bennett</i>—Have I not <em>puffed</em> you well, my
darling?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Fanny</i>—W-e-l-l—y-e-s. Wyckoff says I am
<em>increasing my popularity</em> every day. And
now if you will only continue to <em>puff</em> me, my
dear Mr. Bennett, I will hug and kiss you, and
love you ever so dearly. And do you know
that I intend to give your beautiful wife some
precious jewels?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Bennett</i>—Wyckoff said you contemplated a
splendid donation to my fair lady.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Fanny</i>—O yes, dear Mr. Bennett, the jewels
are all purchased, and your dear wife shall
have them soon.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Bennett</i>—Hush! fair creature! Don’t talk
so loudly. Is the door locked? I hear footsteps.
Some one ascends the stairs. If you
are seen in my lap, old Mordecah M. Noah
will get hold of it, and put it in his Caudle
Lectures, which bite me terribly.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Fanny</i>—The door is locked, and you need
not be afraid, as it is only the servant coming
to bring me some wine and water, and to dust
my parlor.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Bennett</i>—Well, give me one more fervent
kiss, and let in the servant, and I will depart,
and return soon, unless you expect Wyckoff.
It won’t do for us both to be here at the same
time, you know, eh?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Fanny</i>—I hardly think it will, although I
love you both.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Servant</i>—(Knocks.)</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Fanny</i>—Busy! (Servant goes down stairs.)</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Bennett</i>—Which do you love best—me or
Wyckoff?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Fanny</i>—I love you the best, dear Mr. Bennett.
Most people call Wyckoff the handsomest,
but I think you are the prettiest man
I ever saw. Your voice is so sweet, and your
complexion so fair, and your features so Grecian,
and your smile so lovely, and your heart
so kind, and your figure so commanding, and
your eyes so expressive of a large humanity.
O, Mr. Bennett, I most dearly love you, and
now I desire to know if you love me, and how
much? And before you tell me, there’s another
luscious kiss on your fragrant lips. And
now, dear friend, do tell me how much you
love your grateful and affectionate Fanny?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Bennett</i>—O, I love you most ardently, and
I have a mind to give Wyckoff a touch of the
Italian, and marry you, and hide ourselves in
some deep mountain glen of my beloved Scotland.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Fanny</i>—O, if you would only do all that.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Bennett</i>—What! kill Wyckoff, and marry
you, and desert my devoted wife and child?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Fanny</i>—To be sure. Did you not say you
would?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Bennett</i>—O Heaven! Fanny! I am very
nervous. Your extraordinary fascinations will
ruin me, and I must fly.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Fanny</i>—Whither?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Bennett</i>—To my office.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Fanny</i>—What! Havn’t you the pluck to
kill Wyckoff, and marry me, and all my jewels,
and the vast possessions I have acquired
through my grace and agility?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Bennett</i>—Darm it, Fanny, no more to-day.
Give me a parting kiss, and I will go, and we
will resume this delightful theme to-morrow,
when Wyckoff is promenading Broadway, or
arranging your affairs at the Theatre and the
printing offices. So, good-by, my adored
Fanny—farewell, my precious solace and
incomparable divinity.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Fanny</i>—A fond adieu, my charming admirer.
Come again to-morrow, or I shall die.
(She cries like a female Crocodile.)</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Bennett</i>—Farewell.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Fanny</i>—Farewell—my benefactor. O farewell!</p>

<p class='c007'>(He goes, and Fanny leaps, and dances, and
laughs, and screams, and wildly rejoices over
his departure.)</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='connolly' class='c005'>Richard B. Connolly and other Conspirators against my Liberty.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>In 1855, Richard B. Connolly said he would
give me a clerkship in the County Clerk’s
Office, if I would not expose his unnaturalized
alienage. I declined his infamous proposition.
He then got Alderman John Kelly to read a
letter to the Board of Aldermen, declaring
that he was born in Ireland, and first landed
in Philadelphia, where he got naturalized in
Independence Hall, and that he valued the frame
that contained the evidences of his naturalization,
more than any piece of furniture in his
house, and invited all to call at his residence, and
behold its graceful suspension on his parlor wall.
I called, and his wife assured me that her husband
was absent, and that his naturalization
papers were in a trunk, and that he had got
the key. Alderman John H. Briggs called,
when Connolly was at home, but he was not
permitted to see the evidences of his naturalization.
Other citizens, and many of Connolly’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>most intimate friends called and desired
to see his naturalization papers, but he
declined to show them. I then went to Philadelphia,
and got certificates from the clerks of
all the Courts, that Richard B. Connolly, of
Ireland, was never naturalized in the Philadelphia
Courts, and I returned, and published
the results of my visit to Philadelphia in the
<cite>New York Times</cite>, and other journals, and also
stated that Connolly strove to bribe me not to
expose his alienage. At the election of County
Clerk, which followed these events, Connolly
did not vote, and when taunted with his refusal
to vote by his adversaries, he excused
himself on the ground that he had bet largely
on several candidates, and dared not vote.
This was the very small aperture through
which he crawled. And this is the scamp who
is to impannel the jury by which I am soon
to be tried for the alleged libel of Tiemann
and Cooper and Connolly’s most sacred friend,
Simeon Draper, with whom he was long a
clerk, and with whom he has been connected
in schemes of plunder and political villainy for
nearly a quarter of a century. From Connolly’s
notorious character as a sly and cunning
and treacherous rascal, and Jury Packer,
and ballot stuffer, and public robber, I have
every reason to believe that he will pack the
jury that will try me. And he has four
powerful motives for packing my jury, and
sending me to Blackwell’s Island: And firstly,
to avenge my exposure of his perjured alienage,
and secondly, to prove his fidelity to
his old friend, Simeon Draper, and thirdly, to
win the favor of Tiemann and Cooper, and
secure their support of him as Comptroller,
and fourthly, to incarcerate me while he seeks
his nomination and election as Comptroller,
so that I cannot expose his perjured alienage
and nefarious crimes, during his efforts to obtain
an office, which will enable him to steal
millions from the Treasury, and thus rob the
toiling millions of their bread and raiment and
shelter from the pitiless elements, and drive
many a lovely virgin, of sick and indigent
parents, to the horrors of prostitution. In
1852, he was almost penniless, but now he is
worth a million of dollars, which he has
stolen directly from the pockets of the honest
and laborious classes, for whom he professes
exhaustless love. With the Mayor and
nearly all the Executive Departments, and
Connolly, Draper, Sickles, Hart, and the
<cite>Herald</cite>, <cite>Times</cite>, and <cite>Tribune</cite>, and other journals,
and Peter Cooper, and Ex-Mayor Kingsland,
and other millionaires against me, it
seems almost impossible to escape a sojourn
at Blackwell’s Island, but I have confidence
in God and truth and justice, and I defy all
the powers of earth to vanquish my soul.
And I most fervently thank the Great Disposer
of Events, that if I am consigned to a
felon’s cell, it will not be for robbing the
friendless multitudes, like such thieves as Tiemann,
Cooper, Draper, and Connolly, who
may not be incarcerated and tortured for their
deeds of villainy while living, although a
terrible retribution awaits them beyond the
grave. Stephen, of old, was stoned for his
virtues, and Socrates poisoned, and the Saviour
crucified, and a poor, humble, and friendless
being like me, may be imprisoned, and forced
to die in a dungeon, for exposing the public
robbers of the present generation. But I will
not murmur at the terrible ordeal through
which I am about to pass. For my fidelity
to the people, I may lose my liberty. Be it
so. And when the public thieves have consigned
me to a lonely and dreary cell, and my
frail form slowly wastes away, and I am forever
gone, my absent soul will only crave a
humble mound, and the tears of the virtuous,
to bless and fertilise the pretty flowers that
prance over my grassy hillock, in the mild
summer perfume.</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Sedgwick informs me that I will be
tried on the first Monday in August. I shall
be ready, and I dare Mayor Tiemann to meet
me on that memorable day. It grieves me to
know that my witnesses will overwhelm him
with disgrace, because his wife and children
will be degraded through all their posterity.
But for Tiemann, and Peter Cooper, and Edward
Cooper, I have no sympathy, because
they have been recreant to the people, in their
appointment of thieves and assassins to the
most lucrative and honorable offices. Daniel
F. Tiemann has been a hypocrite and a public
thief, since he was Alderman in 1838. Peter
Cooper has been a public plunderer since he
was Alderman in 1828, and a heartless miser
through all his days; and Daniel and Peter
are training young Edward to imitate their
pernicious example. Peter Cooper is the father
of illegitimate children, who reside in the
vicinity of his Glue Factory, at Bushwick, and
Daniel F. Tiemann has long kept a mistress on
Randall’s Island, and committed other deeds
of hell, as I will prove on the first Monday in
August. Let there be no postponement of the
trial, as I yearn for a conflict, that will consign
the foes of the people to undying infamy.</p>

  <h2 id='national' class='c005'>National Degeneration!</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>What a consummate band of scamps wield
the destinies of this nation. From President
to Treasurer, and Collector, and official Sexton,
all is black-mail, fornication, ballot-stuffing,
and unblushing robbery. Who can respect
a President, who will permit such a villain
as James Gordon Bennett to be a guest at
his table, and dictate his domestic and foreign
appointments, and demand the publication of
the “List of Letters” in his chameleon and
most infamous Journal, to the exclusion of the
<cite>New York Sun</cite>, which has the highest city
circulation, and which should publish the Letters
according to the Acts of Congress. Did
not Bennett first support George Law, and
then Fremont, down to the last hour of the
election? And did he not traduce Buchanan,
as no other man in America? And why does
Buchanan kiss the rod that strove to smite
him? And why does he permit him to visit
the White House, as his most distinguished
guest? Is it because he fears he will expose
the motive of his intimate relations with Daniel
E. Sickles, and give some curious reminiscences
of Fanny White’s notorious tour in
Europe, while Dan was his Private Secretary
and flying Minister to Spain? Ostensibly, it
was Buchanan’s fear of Bennett’s hostility to
his Kansas views, but in reality, it was his
dread of Bennett’s disclosure of hellish domestic
events, during Fanny White’s European
pilgrimage, that induced Buchanan to proffer
Bennett the freedom of the White House, and
that forced him to unite Bennett and Sickles
in perpetual friendship. I can show where
Bennett squints at Dan and Fan and Buck in
the <cite>Herald</cite>, which shook the White House to
its deep foundation. Two famous harlots long
kept Daniel E. Sickles and Emanuel B. Hart,
and the latter lives with a woman now, on the
principles of Turkish Free Love. Fanny
White kept Sickles until he went to board
with a dancing master, whose wife he soon
allures from the bed of her husband, and
drives him from his own house. He then
seduces their daughter, a mere child, who
became six month’s pregnant. He now fears
the law, and gets Bishop Hughes to marry
him to the lovely and youthful creature of his
seduction. He then introduces Mayor Ambrose
C. Kingsland to his wife’s mother, with
whom Kingsland has sexual intercourse. He
then asks Mayor Kingsland to give him a
certificate, that he had been married six months
before, to cover the pregnancy of his wife.
Kingsland hesitates, when Dan threatens to expose
his sexual intercourse with his wife’s
mother. Kingsland becomes alarmed and gives
Dan the marriage certificate, and all is tranquil.
When Dan became James Buchanan’s
Private Secretary, at the Court of St. James,
Fanny White visited London, and was very
intimate with Buchanan, and Dan gave her
passports all over Europe, as Mrs. James Gordon
Bennett. Bennett ascertained this, and
hence the long and bitter quarrel between Dan
and Bennett. Dan got the Hon. John Wheeler
to give Fanny White letters of introduction to
certain parties at Niagara Falls, as Mrs. James
Gordon Bennett. Fanny White now lives in
New York, and Dan is still friendly with her,
although she is kept by another. Emanuel
B. Hart was long kept by Eliza Pratt, who
got tired of him, and discarded him. He subsequently
took a notorious wanton, named
Louise Wallace, from a house of ill-fame, and
lives with her now, and introduces her into
the first circles of society. Sickles is now a
member of Congress, and the most influential
man under Buchanan in the White House, and
Hart was appointed by Buchanan, Surveyor
of the Port of New York, which is considered
next in importance to the office of Collector.
And yet there are no earthquakes. And the
people tamely submit to this monstrous degradation.
And these revelations may lead to a
scuffle of death between Sickles, Hart, and myself.
But if I were sure that my brains were
to be strewn upon the pavement, I would disclose
to the American people, that their public
servants are thieves, and fornicators, and
ballot-stuffers, and black-mailers. Public men
who will keep vile women, or (what is infinitely
more degrading,) be kept and fed and clothed
by concubines, like Hart and Sickles, should
be exposed and loathed by all virtuous minds.
And Buchanan should be more despised than
Hart and Sickles, for his known intimacy with
them for years, and with Fanny White, and
for his appointment of Hart as Surveyor, and
for chopping off the heads of a hundred worthy
officials, at the instigation of such a notorious
rake, and thief, and ballot-stuffer as Daniel E.
Sickles. Buchanan fears Sickles, Hart, Bennett,
and Fanny White! God of Heaven!
How the national morals have degenerated
during the present century. At a recent dinner
at the White House sat the President, Bennett,
Russell, Hart and Sickles. The President
sat beside Mrs. Dan Sickles—Bennett sat
next to Mrs. Judge Russell—Russell sat alone—Emanuel
B. Hart sat next to his Mistress,
and Sickles next to Fanny White. What a
mournful sacrilege! Violated shades of Washington!
Jefferson! and Jackson! O Vernon!
and Monticello! and the Hermitage! may thy
hallowed verdure be forever green and fragrant.
And paralysed be the monsters who trample thy
mounds, and blight thy pretty violets. And is
there an American, or a naturalized foreigner
whose cheeks do not crimson at a bacchanal
like this, in the sacred atmosphere of great
Washington’s mausoleum? What! Shall a
gang like this be permitted to desecrate the
halls and seats once occupied by the most illustrious
patriots that ever graced the earth?
O, Father of Heaven! Do not abandon the
honest Americans, nor the patriot pilgrims to
these happy shores, who still are grateful for
Thy protection of their immortal Fathers, and
who will strive to elect men to wield their
destinies, who cherish Thee, and will legislate
for the honor and welfare and glory of their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>beloved country. Do not desert them, O God!
is the fervent prayer of millions of noble
Americans, and of all naturalized foreigners,
who truly love Thee, and the free and sunny
land of their adoption.</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>William O. Webb, now Superintendent of
Potter’s Field, who was appointed by the Ten
Governors, sold and delivered last winter, five
hundred corpses to the body snatchers, and
has sold about the same number for several
winters past, for which he and others received
$17 for each corpse, forming an aggregate of
$8,500 that was received each winter. The
bodies are disinterred in the night, during the
favorable tides, and carried from Potter’s Field
to the Dead House, on the shore of Ward’s
Island,—sometimes in a sleigh, and sometimes
in a wheelbarrow,—and delivered to the body
snatchers, awaiting their arrival at the Dead
House. William O. Webb directs the grave
diggers to give no corpses to the body snatchers,
who died of small pox, or other contagious
diseases, nor badly mutilated bodies. Michael
Gilmore was an Assistant Grave Digger, and
is now a clerk of the Superintendent of Potter’s
Field. Wm. O. Webb’s salary is $800 per
annum—a house free of rent—a farm—fuel, and
provisions, from the Ten Governors—and four
paupers and a servant to manage his farm.
Sometimes he has fifteen paupers to work his
farm. Webb’s clerk receives $400 a year, and
his wife $200, and they have a large house
and extensive grounds, and a servant and fuel
and provisions from the Ten Governors.
Webb employs a boy, about sixteen years old,
who buries the dead, and who has $300 per
annum. This boy receives the dead bodies,
and selects such as the Doctors desire, immediately
on their reception at Potter’s Field.
Sometimes an arm or a leg is dissevered, and
sold to the Doctors. After the bodies are removed,
the coffins are sawed and chopped, and
packed in bags, and taken to Harlem, and used
as fire wood. The bodies are stripped of their
dead clothes, and the best part sold in the city,
as apparel, and the residue as rags, which constantly
exposes the city to contagion. The
Ten Governors are familiar with these facts,
and have some knowledge of what is done
with the money that is received for the dead
bodies. William O. Webb has long been the
warm personal and political friend of Governor
Daniel F. Tiemann, whose mutual relations
have been of such a <em>peculiar nature</em>
that, although Gov. Tiemann has often been
apprised of Webb’s monstrous proceedings, yet
he dared not advance a step towards his removal.
Webb’s expenses as Superintendent
of Potter’s Field are $5,000 per annum. A
respectable man, with the best security,
proposed to Mayor Tiemann, when he was
Governor, to assume the management of
Potter’s Field, for $1,000 per annum, without
the salaries, houses, farms, paupers, and
servants, fuel, and provisions that the Superintendent
and Clerk, and their wives then and
now receive, forming an aggregate of $5,000
per annum, exclusive of the $8,500 received by
the Superintendent and others for dead bodies.
And yet, such were the <em>peculiar relations</em> subsisting
between Gov. Tiemann and Mr. Webb,
that the former dared not accept a proposition
so favorable to the Treasury of the City, for
whose economical disbursements Gov. Tiemann
professes such anxious regard. One of the
grave diggers refused to sell the body snatchers
any more bodies, and informed Gov. Tiemann
of his determination, who exclaimed,
with much levity: “If you interfere with their
business, there will be no inquest held over
your body.” Webb sold the corpse of his
wife’s uncle, whose name was Brown, a builder,
and when Brown’s relatives desired his body for
respectable interment, Webb placed another
corpse in the coffin, and sent it to them, which
they interred as their dear relative. The
Lime Kiln Man was borne to Potter’s Field,
and when his friends heard the sad intelligence
of his death and pauper interment, they raised
funds, which they gave to Webb, with directions
to exhume and respectably inter him.
But Webb could not find the Lime Kiln Man,
and placed another corpse in a coffin, and
buried it, and when the friends of the Lime
Kiln Man came to Potter’s Field, Mr. Webb
led them to a grave, which he assured them
was the Lime Kiln Man’s. At my trial, on
the first Monday in August, I shall summon
the Doctor, and the body snatchers connected
with him, and the superintendent, clerk, grave
diggers, and all others engaged in this awful
sacrilege, to unmask the scoundrels connected
with our public institutions.</p>

  <h2 id='bgr' class='c005'>Bennett, Greeley, and Raymond.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>New York is the seat of Commerce, affluence,
intelligence, and journalism, and the
devil has placed at the head of the Press, three
such rogues as Bennett, Greeley, and Raymond.
I have personally known these desperate
jugglers for twenty years, and if the
reader is sceptical, when I brand them as unparalleled
scoundrels, let him refer to the files
of these editors, who fiercely denounce, and
clearly prove each other to be incomparable
villains, and in parallel columns, they assume
to be the censors of the public morals, and
anathematise rogues of every grade and country,
whom they strive to allure to the
embraces of the sacred virtues. The mighty
destinies of our country are in the grasp of
heartless black mail editors, and Bennett,
Greeley, and Raymond never unite in matters
of public good, nor in the election of meritorious
citizens to public office. And when they
scream loudest for the propagation of the public
virtues, and the creation of wise public
measures, their eyes are fastened on the devil,
and his imps, and overshadowing schemes of
public plunder. Their opinions have not half
the force and purity of the humblest citizens,
and yet, like foreign despots, they thrust their
heresies into our skulls, and in connection
with officials, as infamous as themselves,
(whom they elect,) they trample our most
sacred rights, and slyly appropriate the public
treasure, and violate all laws, human and divine,
and from whose editorial edicts there is
no appeal. And thus the public evils of our
country flow from such polluted sources, as
the <cite>Herald</cite>, <cite>Times</cite>, and <cite>Tribune</cite>. If these
three editors were as pure and patriotic as
they profess to be, they would unite in the
advocation of honest men for office, and discharge
their thievish correspondents at Albany
and Washington, (who are in collusion with
official robbers, by direction of their employers,)
and invariably oppose the election of
vicious men to office. Bennett, Greeley, and
Raymond, and other editorial rogues, never
advocate the election of a man to office, without
the pledge of a share of his influence and
spoils, which is the real source of our public
evils. They black mail on a scale of startling
magnitude and boldness. They watch, with
ceaseless vigilance, for facilities to seize the
pap from the private and public purse. They
level their fleetest and most envenomed
arrows at the subordinate municipal officers,
Mayors, Governors, National Collectors, Representatives,
Senators, Cabinet officers, and
the President, himself, whom they force to
yield to their demands, or they spread terror
into the camps of these public vultures. Bennett,
Greeley, and Raymond have obtained
their prodigious power, through the large
number of fools that read their nonsense, and
black mail philippics. If these idiots would
cease to read their vile and selfish stuff, and
patronise those editors who proclaim the
truth, and strive to promote the public welfare,
such men as Bennett, Greeley, and Raymond
would soon become the paupers and
loafers and scamps of twenty years ago, when
they had no place to lay their wicked skulls,
nor credit for a loaf of bread.</p>

  <h2 id='cooper' class='c005'>The Peter Cooper Institute!</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>In front of this sham Institute is painted, in
blazing letters: “These Stores, and the Story
above to Let. Enquire in office, 2d story.”
And Peter might have advertised a portion of
the stories above the two lower stories, as he
has rooms to let in every story of the building.
Even around the lecture room, in the
second and third stories, he has constructed
small rooms to let to any adventurer who
comes along. Such was his avarice, and so
greedy was he to gouge all the area he possibly
could from earth and Heaven, that he dug
as far towards China as he dared, and approached
Heaven’s dome, until his architect
warned him to stop, lest the whole edifice
tumble into one common ruin, so feeble was
the building’s foundation. And now, Peter
Cooper! I demand you to instantly surrender
your right and that of your heirs, (including
Mayor Tiemann and Edward Cooper,) to the
building known as the Cooper Institute. You
have made a great noise, for half a dozen years,
about your extraordinary philanthropy, and
you have publicly proclaimed, a thousand
times, that you intended to give your “Art
and Science” edifice to the city, <em>entirely</em> for
educational purposes. And you have got its
tax of $8,000 reduced with this plea. And you
have also got the Croton water tax removed,
although you have got a steam engine in the
building. And yet you still hold the property,
in the name of yourself and heirs, and from
what I know of your penurious propensities,
I could almost swear that you never meant to
give it to the city. Was not the building publicly
dedicated long since? And where are
the three thousand pupils, with green satchels,
with whom we all expected to see the building
teem? There is more cheerfulness and
utility in the deserts of Arabia, and the classic
ruins and crumbling desolations of the Ancient
States, than in the dismal and Shylock echoes
of your bogus and uncomely structure. And
why do you still clutch it to your heart, like
an expiring miser, his miserable dross? And
why did you so construct the building, as to
render it utterly inappropriate for students?
You have told beggars, high and low, for half
a dozen years, that you could not give them
a crum of bread, because you were devoting
all your surplus means to the construction of
the Cooper Institute. And now that it is
erected, and you have got all you desired,
(and have toiled thirty years to achieve,) in
the election of Tiemann, your son-in-law, as
Mayor, through your specious and fallacious
Philanthropy, and in the appointment of Edward
Cooper, your own son, as Street Commissioner,
by Tiemann,—after you have reached
the goal of your miserly and ungodly ambition,
and have got all New York in your
breeches pocket, I find you apply your fingers
to your infernal nose, and hurl defiance at the
people, whom you have bamboozled, and
evince a disposition to forever hold the building
over which you have raised such a clatter
for half a dozen years, and now actually advertise
the stores and rooms of nearly the entire
edifice, and of course, will put the rents
in your yawning pockets, in the name of the
President and Board of Trustees of the immortal
Cooper Institute, which illustrious
Chartered Body only comprises Peter Cooper!
O Peter! Peter! you are a consummate impostor,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>and all the people will soon conceive you
to be so, unless you instantly disgorge the
property you long promised to give them for
educational purposes. And now, Peter, go to
the City Hall at once, and record the Institute
in the name of the people, who will ever bless
you for your noble philanthropy.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
